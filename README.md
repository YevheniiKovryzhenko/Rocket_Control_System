# rcs
Welcome to the  Rocket Control System!
This code was made for Aubutn Rocketry Team and is a heavy overhaul of a drone control system.
		rc_pilot was the original lighweight flight code for controlling a multirotor developed by 
		Dr. Stawson, Dr. Gaskell and others - https://github.com/StrawsonDesign/rc_pilot
		
It is critical to learn and understand the flightcode before using it. Make sure you know
what you are doing and don't hold me liable for any equipment damage and follow the law!

THIS CODE IS NOT FOR PUBLIC USE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. THIS CAN AND WILL GET YOU IN JAIL IF MISUSED.
